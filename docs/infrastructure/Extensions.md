# Extensions

The infrastructure/extensions folder defines additional files for setting up/deploying the AWS application, such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk platform hooks to execute before building.
The folders/files need to be compatible with the specific cloud provider, so specific names are used. See the files for additional documentation.
