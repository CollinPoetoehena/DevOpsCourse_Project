# Scripts

To run the scripts, make sure the configuration file is created appropriately before executing any scripts:
```sh
# Create a config.sh file in the scripts folder and fill it with the necessary configuration variables for your local project

# Go to the scripts folder
cd scripts
# Then you can execute scripts in this folder, as they use the variables from the config.sh file
```
